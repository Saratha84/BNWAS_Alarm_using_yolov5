🚀 Enhancing Bridge Watchkeeping with AI-Powered Real-Time Detection

Traditional Bridge Navigational Watch Alarm Systems (BNWAS) often rely on simple motion sensors, pressure mats, or manual resets to confirm the officer’s alertness. However, these systems:

❌ Cannot differentiate between people and irrelevant movements
❌ Require manual interaction, risking missed alarms
❌ Lack real-time visual confirmation

✨ Today, I implemented a YOLOv5-based person detection system that overcomes these limitations by directly detecting human presence using a webcam feed.

✅ Differentiates humans from other objects
✅ Eliminates false alarms
✅ Provides continuous visual monitoring
✅ Automatically triggers an alarm if no person is detected for a set duration
